# 19 Progressive Web Applications (PWA): Text Editor

## Task

This project focused on building a text editor that runs in the browser. The app is a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application also functions offline.

## User Story
